# UI Enhancement Plan

## Information Gathered
- Frontend is a React app with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI.
- Pages: Login, Signup, Tickets (list and create), Ticket Details, Admin Panel.
- Components: Navbar, CheckAuth.
- Current UI is functional but plain: uses basic DaisyUI components, gray backgrounds (bg-gray-400), no icons, no animations, no custom themes.
- No icon library installed.

## Plan
- [x] Install lucide-react for icons.
- [x] Customize Tailwind/DaisyUI theme for a modern, eye-catching look (e.g., dark mode or vibrant colors).
- [x] Add global styles: gradients, backgrounds, animations.
- [x] Enhance each page/component:
  - [x] Navbar: Add icons, better layout.
  - [x] Login/Signup: Add icons, hero background, improved form design.
  - [x] Tickets: Attractive form, priority-based card colors, hover effects, icons.
  - [x] Ticket Details: Better card with icons, markdown styling.
  - [x] Admin: Improved user cards with icons, better layout.
- [x] Add transitions and animations for interactivity.

## Dependent Files to Edit
- [x] frontend/package.json: Add lucide-react dependency.
- [x] frontend/tailwind.config.js: Custom theme configuration.
- [x] frontend/src/index.css: Global styles and animations.

- [x] frontend/src/pages/tickets.jsx: Improve form and cards.

## Followup Steps
